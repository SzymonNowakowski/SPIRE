/** \brief This class computes the euclidean distance map of a structure
 *
 * This class computes the distance transformation of a picture. It is
 * based on an algorithm published by Pedro F. Felzenszwalb and Daniel
 * P. Huttenlocher, THEORY OF COMPUTING , Volume 8 (2012), pp. 415â€“428.
 * 10.4086/toc.2012.v008a019
 *
 * It is based on a one-dimensional distance transform. For higher
 * dimensional cases, the 1D transform is applied repeatetly. See the
 * publication for more details.
 *
 * This class comes as a template, so distance maps of ints, floats,
 * doubles,[...] can be computed without first converting the
 * vector. Internally it will be converted to a double in the \ref
 * eval_grid_function function. So make sure it can be converted to a
 * floating point number
 * 
 * ToDo: remove implicit integral type <-> floating point type conversions
 *
 *
